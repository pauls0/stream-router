# stream-router
Take home project


### Spec: 
- You’ll need to create an API which accepts an IP address and returns the best location for that IP address to retrieve a stream from. 
- Use Node/Typescript, Lambda functions and if possible CloudFormation
```
GET /?ip=1.2.3.4 
{
“host”: “A-001” 
}
```
Each IP range will fall into 3 different networks, you’ll be provided several CIDR ranges to map each IP to a network:
```
{"cidr" : "10.0.0.0/7", "network”: 1}
{"cidr" : "12.0.0.0/6", "network”: 2}
{"cidr" : "16.0.0.0/4", "network”: 3}
{"cidr" : "32.0.0.0/3", "network”: 2}
{"cidr" : "64.0.0.0/3", "network”: 1}
{"cidr" : "96.0.0.0/4", "network”: 1}
{"cidr" : "112.0.0.0/5", "network”: 2}
{"cidr" : "120.0.0.0/7", "network”: 1}
{"cidr" : "122.0.0.0/8", "network”: 3}
{"cidr" : "123.0.0.0/32", "network”: 1}
```
You’ll be provided several sites in the format of:
```
{"CDN": “A”, "cidr": "112.2.0.0/15", "host": "A-001"}
{“CDN”: “B”, "cidr": "32.5.0.0/16", "host": "B-001"}
{"CDN": “A”, "cidr": "112.4.0.0/32", "host": "A-002"}
{"CDN": “B”, "cidr": "32.7.0.0/32", "host": "B-002"}
```
And default routes specified the same, but without a cidr range attached:
```
{"CDN": “B”, "host": "B-1023"}
{"CDN": “C”, "host": "C"}
```

- All the above configuration will be provided as files of new line delimited JSON objects which you’ll need to be able to ingest and process
- Create a web interface for each of the 3 different networks where I can select each network to go to CDN A, B or C as a toggle. 
- The web interface should also have a panel to use the query function

Summary:
- I have IP address X
- Which network is X in? Suppose it’s 2
- Which CDN is serving network 2? Suppose it’s B
- Which host for CDN B matches this IP? Suppose none do, Return the default route
